/**
 * ThereminAudioEngine provides real-time theremin-like audio that responds to MacBook lid angle changes.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Real-time sine wave synthesis based on lid angle
 * - Smooth frequency transitions to avoid audio artifacts
 * - Volume control based on angular velocity
 * - Configurable frequency range mapping
 * - Low-latency audio generation
 * 
 * Audio Behavior:
 * - Lid angle maps to frequency (closed = low pitch, open = high pitch)
 * - Movement velocity controls volume (slow movement = loud, fast = quiet)
 * - Smooth parameter interpolation for musical quality
